  Ever stared at a legal letter feeling completely lost? You're not alone! Legal documents are often packed with confusing words and strange sentences that just don't make sense to most of us. That's exactly why we built ClearCourt – to help you finally understand what those papers actually mean, without needing to hire a lawyer every time.

  It's really simple to use: just upload your court letter, a notice, or any legal document you're struggling with. ClearCourt quickly reads through it, picks out the important stuff like who's involved, what needs to be done, and any deadlines. Then, it explains all of that in plain, everyday English. We don't just tell you what the words mean; we also help you understand what's at stake and give you clear advice on your next steps.

  Our goal with ClearCourt is to make legal stuff less stressful and much easier to handle. Whether it's something about your landlord, a small court case, or just a new agreement you're signing, we want to give you the confidence to know what's happening. Stop guessing and start understanding – ClearCourt is here to clear things up for you!
